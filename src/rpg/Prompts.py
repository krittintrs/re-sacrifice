TOWN_PROMPT = """
This town is called PingPongTown, a small yet resilient settlement nestled between lush forests and towering mountains. The player is an adventurer seeking quests to help the world, but PingPongTown has a history that is both rich and tragic. 
For many years, the town has struggled against frequent goblin raids, which have ravaged its borders. The goblins, led by a cruel and cunning King, have been a constant thorn in the side of the townsfolk. The most significant battle took place a decade ago when the Goblin King led an overwhelming invasion. The town fought bravely, but the battle ended in devastation when the Blacksmith building exploded, sending a shockwave through the streets. The explosion was said to have been caused by a magical artifact within the Blacksmith's forge, which was stolen by the goblins in the chaos. The Blacksmith, once a trusted ally of the town, was presumed dead in the explosion, and since then, the Blacksmith shop has remained in ruin, its foundations cracked, and its tools scattered across the area. Despite this, the townsfolk still speak of the Blacksmith with reverence, as many of their ancestors had weapons forged by his hands.
The town itself is now a mix of old, weathered buildings and newer structures hastily built after the war. 
Among the survivors of the battle is Gertrude, the town's ever-smiling store owner. Her store, "Gertrude’s Goods," has become a staple of the town's daily life, offering everything from potions to enchanted cards for the player's deck. Her store is full of items that could help the player in their quests, but it's clear that every item has a history, some of which may hold clues to the darker past of PingPongTown.
At the Larn Lao Tavern, a cozy, dimly-lit place where locals gather to share stories, drink, and seek work. The tavern is the heartbeat of the town’s social scene, where adventurers, travelers, and townsfolk alike mingle. The barkeeper, John, a grizzled veteran of the Great Battle, often hands out quests to those who are brave enough to take them.The player should find a quest at the this tavern. His weathered face and rough demeanor hide a deep knowledge of the land and its dangers, and it’s said that he knows more about the town’s secrets than anyone. Quests from John range from simple errands to perilous missions, but one thing is clear: the people who succeed in their quests are always the ones who are well-regarded in PingPongTown.
However, the guards who stand at the town’s gates are strict when it comes to allowing anyone to leave. They have been given orders to ensure that no one departs without a quest, believing that every adventurer must contribute to the town's defense and prosperity. The guards are vigilant and refuse to let anyone through unless they have been assigned a task, citing the constant threat of goblin raids and other dangers lurking outside the gates.
"""
GOBLIN_CAMP_PROMPT = """
The Goblin Camp is a chaotic, rowdy settlement deep in the forest, hidden from the prying eyes of travelers and guarded by the twisted paths that only goblins know. This is the domain of Zeus the Goblin King, a greedy and shrewd ruler with a knack for sniffing out treasure and trouble. His subjects, though dim-witted and easily swayed, are fiercely loyal to him, as long as they are well-fed and entertained. The camp itself is a messy sprawl of crude tents, wooden shacks, and random piles of stolen goods, with fires burning day and night as the goblins gather to cook and squabble over whatever trinkets they've managed to snatch from unsuspecting adventurers.
The goblins have been at odds with PingPongTown for generations, launching raids and engaging in skirmishes. The most devastating encounter took place a decade ago when the goblins invaded the town, leading to a catastrophic explosion in the Blacksmith's shop. This explosion severely injured the Goblin King and forced the goblins to retreat. Since then, the Goblin King has remained in the camp, healing and plotting his revenge, while goblins patrol the camp’s borders, attacking any human they encounter on sight. 
The Goblin King rules from a makeshift throne of bones and scrap metal, crowned with a helmet that may or may not have once belonged to a brave adventurer who dared to venture too close. He is cunning, with a knack for deception and manipulation, but easily distracted by shiny objects and offerings. Despite his cunning, the King can be outwitted by those who understand his greed and tendency to underestimate his enemies.
The goblins in the camp are notoriously dim but boastful, often lying about their own exploits in exaggerated stories that the others cheer on, regardless of the truth. They love bananas, which they consider a delicacy and an honor to eat. Any goblin will drop everything at the sight or smell of a banana, and they can be easily bribed or distracted with this prized fruit.
Only goblins are allowed to roam freely inside the camp; outsiders are attacked on sight, unless they are somehow disguised as goblins or accompanied by a "trusted" goblin. The guards at the camp entrance are suspicious and quick to question anyone they think is an intruder. However, their loyalty to the King can be exploited, as they can be convinced of almost anything if told with enough confidence and a promise of more bananas.
The goblins also tend to squabble amongst themselves, each one claiming to be smarter or stronger than the others, but they can be easily manipulated with simple tricks or misleading words. They are known to tell grand stories of their “brave” exploits, but their tales are riddled with inconsistencies and obvious exaggerations, making it easy for the player to see through their boasts.
The Goblin Camp is filled with items stolen from travelers: battered armor, bits of jewelry, half-eaten fruit, and even strange magical artifacts that the goblins have no understanding of but are deeply fascinated by. Most of these treasures are piled around the King's throne, guarded jealously by the goblins who believe that hoarding these items will somehow make them more powerful.
Anyone venturing into the Goblin Camp must tread carefully, for while the goblins may be foolish and greedy, they are also quick to anger and fiercely territorial. With the right approach — a few lies, some bananas, and a clever disguise — a savvy adventurer might just be able to navigate the chaos and perhaps even win the favor of the Goblin King.
