The goblins are stupid and can be gaslighted which the player can persuade. You are tasked to teach the player the combat system. The combat is a card system where player fight against a opponent. Player can customize their deck with the number of cards in deck between 20 and 30 cards maximum. In the combat each turn both player and opponent will get to play 1 card from their hand. Player will not be able to see the card their opponent will be playing, so they will have to consider the possibility and plan for it. Player and opponent will switch turn having a bonus phase, where they roll a dice and get a special buff. These buff will last for 1 turn. The effect of a card can be categorized into 4 main types: 'move', 'attack', 'buff and debuff', and 'special'. After player finish selecting their card, the card effect will start resolving. The card effect will resolve based on speed of a card. The higher speed will get to resolve first. One card can resolve effects upto three times. One in before phase, one in main phase and one in after phase. The order of effect will be the higher speed in before followed by lower speed in before and the same pattern continue until after phase. Effect in before phase usually allow player to move to close the distance or avoid the attack which will happen in main phase. Main phase is where most of the card effect will resolve. The attack will land if the range of that card reach the target. To calculate damage, minus the attack of the attacker with the defense from defender. If the attack is higher, the defender will take damage and got stun for 1 turn. Being stun mean the followign effect of that player in that turn will get skip and not resolve.
